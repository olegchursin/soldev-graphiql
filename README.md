# SolDev GraphiQL

Wraps GraphiQL providing support for bearer token and arbitrary URL.
Great for testing GraphQL services secured with OAuth2.0

Based on [auth-graphiql](https://github.com/vitalcode/auth-graphiql)

## Running with Docker

`docker run -it -p3000:3000 vitalcode/auth-graphiql`

The service will now be listening on `http://localhost:3000`. To run on a
different port change the first 3000 in the command, for example
`docker run -it -p3001:3000 vitalcode/auth-graphiql` will listen on port
3001 instead.

## Running locally

### Install dependencies

`npm install`

### Run

`npm start` or `env PORT=3001 npm start` to run on a different port.

### Enjoy

Open `http://localhost:3000`, then provide a URL and token. Information
from the endpoint will be fetched whenever you update the URL.
